## üß© Introduction

**Push Swap** is a project at 42 school that challenges you to sort a stack of integers using **two stacks (A and B)** and a limited set of operations, with the goal of using as few instructions as possible.  
The program outputs the list of instructions that sort the initial stack.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Parse and validate input arguments.
- Manipulate two stacks using a defined set of operations.
- Implement a sorting algorithm optimized for minimal moves.
- Output the sorting instructions to standard output.

## üîß Allowed Instructions

| Operation | Description                        |
|----------|------------------------------------|
| `sa`     | Swap the first two elements of A    |
| `sb`     | Swap the first two elements of B    |
| `ss`     | `sa` and `sb` at the same time      |
| `pa`     | Push the first element of B to A    |
| `pb`     | Push the first element of A to B    |
| `ra`     | Rotate A upward                     |
| `rb`     | Rotate B upward                     |
| `rr`     | `ra` and `rb` at the same time      |
| `rra`    | Reverse rotate A                    |
| `rrb`    | Reverse rotate B                    |
| `rrr`    | `rra` and `rrb` at the same time    |

## ‚ùó Constraints

- You may only use the operations listed above.
- You cannot use any standard library sort function.
- Input must be validated (integers, no duplicates, within `int` range).
- The goal is to **minimize the number of operations**.

## üß† Algorithm Used ‚Äì Turk‚Äôs Greedy Algorithm

The Turk algorithm is a smart greedy method that works in two main phases:

1. **Push to Stack B**:
   - Send all non-extreme values to stack B using `pb`.
   - Keep only 2-3 elements in A.

2. **Greedy Insertion**:
   - For each element in B, calculate the cheapest move to insert it into its correct position in A.
   - Use a combination of `ra`, `rb`, `rra`, `rrb`, and their doubles (`rr`, `rrr`) to minimize rotations.

3. **Final Rotate**:
   - Once B is empty, rotate A until the smallest element is on top using `ra`/`rra`.

This approach is highly efficient and usually produces a low number of operations without needing full brute-force sorting.

## üõ† Compilation

```bash
make
````

Other targets:

```bash
make clean     # Remove object files
make fclean    # Remove object files and executable
make re        # Rebuild everything
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
./push_swap <list of integers>
```

Example:

```bash
./push_swap 3 2 5 1 4
```

Output:

```
pb
pb
sa
pa
pa
ra
```

You can test your result with the provided checker:

```bash
ARG="3 2 5 1 4"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```

---

## üí° Examples

```bash
./push_swap 5 2 3 1 4
./push_swap 2 1 3
./push_swap 8 4 2 6 1 9 0
```
