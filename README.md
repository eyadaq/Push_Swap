# Push_swap: Sorting Algorithm Visualization

**Push_swap** is a sorting algorithm project from the 42 curriculum. It involves creating a program to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The project is designed to demonstrate algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.

## Features

- **Algorithm Design**: Leveraging the Turkish Algorithm for efficient sorting.
- **Operation Optimization**: Minimizing the number of moves to achieve a sorted stack.
- **Memory Management**: Ensuring proper memory allocation and deallocation in C.
- **Visualization**: Detailed logging of operations for debugging and analysis.

This project serves as a foundation for understanding advanced sorting techniques, stack manipulation, and algorithm optimization.
